# Handcrafted_CNN_models-Moments_hu_complexes_zernike
* We used 2 models on the cifar datasets which are densenet121 and VGG16 and we tried to compare the performance of these models with the moments invariants (scale , rotation , translation ) and compare them to CNN models .
* The moments invariants used are Zernike Moments Invariants, 7 Hu moments  invariants and Complex Moments invraints .
